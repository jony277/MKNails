## 🎯 The Big Picture (Your Challenge)

You're building:
1. **A website customers can book appointments** (Saturday-Sunday, 9am-6pm)
2. **A dashboard for MK to manage everything** (no technical knowledge required)
3. **A system for collecting reviews** (SMS + QR code, automated)
4. **Gallery & social media integration** (Instagram feed displays)
5. **All of this owns the data** (not dependent on Square, completely yours)

**Value to you:**
- Production-ready portfolio piece
- Reference for future websites
- $150-300/hour freelance skills
- Your step mom has professional online presence
- Complete control over all data and updates

## ⏱️ Timeline

```
Days 1-3:   Setup + Database + Authentication (Learn infrastructure)
Days 4-5:   Customer booking website (Learn frontend)
Days 6-8:   Admin dashboard (Learn backend admin patterns)
Days 9-10:  Testing + Live deployment (Learn DevOps)

Total: ~45-55 hours over 10 days = 5-6 hours/day
```

## 📱 The Tech Stack (Why Each Technology)

| What | Technology | Why It Matters |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| **Booking Calendar** | React + JavaScript | Industry standard, skills transfer everywhere |
| **Admin Dashboard** | React | Same framework as customer site (code reuse) |
| **Server** | Node.js + Express | JavaScript backend, one language everywhere |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL | Free, powerful, professional-grade |
| **Hosting** | Vercel + Railway | Automatic deploys on git push, super cheap |
| **Reviews** | Twilio SMS | 40%+ response rate (people respond to texts) |
| **Photos** | Cloudinary | Unlimited uploads, image optimization |
| **Design** | Tailwind CSS | Modern, responsive, professional look |

**Bottom line**: This stack = what professional web developers use. Learning it = $150/hour+ value.

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Is 10 days realistic?**
A: Yes. We're doing 5-6 hours/day of focused work. You're not learning from scratch, you're building with guidance. By day 5, you'll be moving fast.

**Q: Do I need to be a coding expert?**
A: No. You understand concepts, I'm walking you through the code. By day 3 you'll see patterns repeating and it'll start clicking.

**Q: What if I get stuck?**
A: You've got detailed documentation, we can debug together, and the architecture is straightforward. Backend/frontend/database all separated clearly.

**Q: Can I use this as a reference later?**
A: Exactly. That's the whole point. When you build the next website, you copy this structure and modify for the new business. Way faster.

**Q: What about payment processing?**
A: We're prepping for it (architecture is ready), but MK can collect cash/card at salon for now. Adding Stripe later is 2 hours of work.

**Q: Does MK need tech knowledge?**
A: Zero. Dashboard looks like any other admin panel. You'll train her on Day 10. If she's used Square, this is simpler.

**Q: What if the 10 days doesn't work?**
A: No problem. The structure is ready so you can work at your pace. 15 days is totally fine. The docs don't expire.

## 🔑 Success Formula

**Part 1: Follow the docs**
- Each day has clear tasks
- Success metrics tell you when you're done
- Build in order (Day 1 → Day 2, etc.)

**Part 2: Don't overthink**
- Use the code examples given
- Customize colors/text later
- Minimum viable product first

**Part 3: Test as you go**
- Don't build 5 days then test
- After each feature, try it
- Breaks are easier to fix early

**Part 4: Document your learnings**
- Keep notes on what confused you
- How you solved problems
- Next time you build this, you're 10x faster
